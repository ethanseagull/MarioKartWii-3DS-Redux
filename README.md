# Mario Kart Wii 3DS Redux

A native Nintendo 3DS port of Mario Kart Wii. This fork builds on
[Epic0522's Redux](https://github.com/Epic0522/MarioKartWii-3DS-Redux) and adds
Old 3DS support, ghosts, graphics settings and general optimization.

No game files are included. Everything is converted from your own disc.

## Features

- All 32 courses in Grand Prix, Time Trials and VS
- Grand Prix at 50cc, 100cc, 150cc and Mirror
- VS solo or in teams, Balloon Battle and Coin Runners
- All characters and vehicles, unlocks, award ceremonies and credits
- Mii drivers
- Four licenses with their own settings and records
- Staff ghosts, Expert Staff ghosts and your own saved ghosts
- Dual-screen menus, results and maps using the game's original art, effects and audio
- Runs on New 3DS and Old 3DS, optimized for both
- Settings for texture quality, dynamic shadows, bloom and opponent detail
- Speedometer and notification LED effects

## What you need

- Your own **Mario Kart Wii USA** disc (RMCE01) as an ISO or WBFS
- A Windows, macOS or Linux computer with an internet connection and about 30 GB free
- A 3DS with Luma3DS and FBI, and about 3 GB free on the SD card
- DSP firmware dumped with DSP1, if your console has never had homebrew sound

## Building

### Windows

1. Download this repository and unzip it, or clone it.
2. Double-click `Build.bat` and select your disc.

Anything missing, including Python, Git and devkitPro, is downloaded for you.
When it's done it deletes the converted data, leaving about 3 GB.

Or run the build script yourself. Install Python 3.12, Git, and devkitPro with
`3ds-dev` and `gcc`. Then, from a clone:

```sh
py -3.12 tools/build.py --disc "C:/Games/RMCE01.wbfs"
```

### macOS

Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh), then the tools:

```sh
brew install git python@3.12 node ffmpeg-full gcc@16
curl -LO https://github.com/devkitPro/pacman/releases/latest/download/devkitpro-pacman-installer.pkg
sudo installer -pkg devkitpro-pacman-installer.pkg -target /
```

On Apple Silicon, also run `softwareupdate --install-rosetta`.

Open a new terminal, then build:

```sh
sudo dkp-pacman -S --needed --noconfirm 3ds-dev
git clone https://github.com/ethanseagull/MarioKartWii-3DS-Redux.git
cd MarioKartWii-3DS-Redux
export CXX=g++-16
export FFMPEG="$(brew --prefix ffmpeg-full)/bin/ffmpeg"
python3.12 tools/build.py --disc ~/Games/RMCE01.wbfs
```

### Linux

On Ubuntu 24.04 (x86-64), install the tools:

```sh
sudo apt install git python3.12 python3.12-venv build-essential nodejs npm ffmpeg wget
wget https://apt.devkitpro.org/install-devkitpro-pacman
chmod +x install-devkitpro-pacman
sudo ./install-devkitpro-pacman
sudo dkp-pacman -S --needed --noconfirm 3ds-dev
```

Then build:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ethanseagull/MarioKartWii-3DS-Redux.git
cd MarioKartWii-3DS-Redux
python3.12 tools/build.py --disc ~/Games/RMCE01.wbfs
```

Other distributions need the same tools: Python 3.12 exactly, GCC 13 or newer,
Node.js, an ffmpeg with soxr, and [devkitPro](https://devkitpro.org/wiki/Getting_Started).

### All systems

Only Windows has been tested so far. Add `--delete-converted` to the build
script to delete the converted data afterwards.

The first build takes about an hour. If it stops, run it again and it picks up
where it left off. The results are in `build/standard/output`.

## Installing

1. Copy the `sd/3ds` folder to the root of your SD card.
2. Install the `.cia` file with FBI, or run `mkw-3ds.3dsx` from the Homebrew Launcher.

## Updating

Run `Build.bat` again, or from your clone:

```sh
git pull
py -3.12 tools/build.py --disc "C:/Games/RMCE01.wbfs"
```

On macOS or Linux, use the `python3.12` command from your build instead, with
the same `export` lines on macOS. Only what changed is rebuilt, which usually takes a few minutes. An update that
changes game data does a full build. Then repeat the install steps. Your saves
are kept.

If you're coming from a version before 1.0.0, first delete everything in
`sd:/3ds/mkw-3ds/` except `rksys.dat`, `settings.dat`, `last-license.txt`, the
`license-options-*.dat` and `mii-*.3dsmii` files, and the `ghosts` folder.

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for what's new.
